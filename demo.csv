1,St. Vincent's University Hospital,"I was admitted on in May for an intervention radiology surgery. I was really nervous but the nurses and doctors were brilliant, before and after the surgery. They explained everything and really put me at ease before the surgery and afterwards they were very attentive and looked after me very well. The nurses in St. Helens ward were lovely as well and the doctors who discharged me answered all my questions and explained everything I needed to know about about after care very clearly."
2,South Tipperary General,"Omg filthy kip, not fit for purpose! I was not impressed with nurses and doctors. Better care at the vets!"
3,Hermitage Medical Clinic,The team I saw have restored my faith in hospitals.
4,"Bon Secours Hospital, Glasnevin","The quality of nursing care was dependent on the staff. Two staff were not at all helpful when after an operation and not eating for several hours, the consultant had to tell them to feed me. Other aspects of care were wanting but only from these nurses. The other staff were lovely."
5,South Infirmary - Victoria University Hospital,"I have nothing more than the greatest respect, regard and gratitude to all the staff at the South Infirmary, especially those lovely people in Victoria Ward 1 who took such loving care of my mother. Forever grateful, Caitlin Begley Moloney."
6,Cork University Hospital,"During 7 weeks of daily visits to the radiotherapy department, we met excellent staff who were very friendly, caring and helpful. The service was very organised, and well run. Everyone in the department made the treatment somewhat bareable. We are very grateful for the care received."
7,South Infirmary - Victoria University Hospital,Poor follow up care after surgery. Couldn’t get in touch with relevant staff member. Staff on the ward rude. Poor communication between teams and with family. Overall disappointed.
8,Galway Clinic,Reception staff just stand there either staring at you or giving you a look to go away if they are on the phone. Truly bad customer service. No respect.
9,St. Vincent's University Hospital,"If I ever have to go back to hospital and I had a choice of where I was going, it would definitely be St. Vincent’s."
10,"Bon Secours Hospital, Tralee","Consultant was a nice man but overworked and never sent test results to my GP. Asked for follow-up appointment, but declined so went to another hospital."
11,Midland Regional Hospital Portlaoise,Catering and cleaning staff were lovely and could not be more helpful. Midwives were great and have no hesitation in recommending. Had both babies here with no issues.
12,"University College Hospital, Galway",Well done to the leadership/management at NUIG for the Productive Ward initiative.
13,Cavan General Hospital,I could not fault the care I received in any way in the ED.
14,Cork University Hospital,"Came for my yearly check up and as part of that I have to give blood for a blood test. The ticketing system used is a joke. Two separate queues depending on whether you are there after referral from a particular consultant or other. That isn't explained or sign posted very well. I spent over an hour waiting after taking a ticket to be then told when my number was called that I was in the wrong queue and had to take another ticket and wait again. Waited another hour with this new ticket and nothing happened. No numbers were being called out. Then eventually found out that there was another smaller waiting room (in the coagulation centre) where people had queued up, so sat in there waiting for my ticket to be called but no ticket system was in place. Nurse didn't know who the next number was so just shouted who's next. I'd had enough by this time so just walked out. Absolute shocking service. A simple system needs to be applied here that both patients and staff know. The hospital and staff are very efficient at making a simple process not work."
15,Letterkenny General Hospital,Very disappointed with my overall stay/experience in in Letterkenny University Hospital. There is a serious shortage of medical staff resulting in a lack of personal care .
16,Rotunda Hospital Dublin,"Severe staff shortages when I had my baby. No maternity pads, no sheets changed even though I was suffering from incontinence and had been to theatre. Flu outbreak on ward. No doctor physically examined me upon discharge or the day after theatre. Six months postpartum and still incontinent. Long debacle to get my notes. Would never use this hospital again."
17,"Our Lady's Hospital, Navan","Too many old people bed blocking, not allowing beds for injured and sick emergency clients."
18,"Our Lady's Hospital, Navan","This is a nice hospital with a small ED. Impossible to get a trolley, just a hard chair for 24 hours. Diagnosis is slow and nurses work hard. Wards are just ok."
19,"Our Lady's Hospital, Navan","My grandmother was left in A&E for 23 hours. The doctors kept fobbing us off after she had gone there numerous times in the space of 3 months as she didn't feel right. They told her she had a particular illness and started treatment. Over the weekend she got significantly worse. When the doctors decided to actually talk to us the following week, they told us she had something else entirely. She died in a horrible ward almost 8 weeks later. We loved the nurses and carers and so did my nan. The hospital is just so horrible and the doctors were so blunt and hard to pin down for a chat. They also told us she was getting better and would return to herself, days after we were told to prepare and think about hospice care. Rollercoaster doesn't describe how the made us feel. My nan knew she wasn't well from even before Christmas but was sent home every time. If you know your body, don't let them tell you nothing is wrong!"
20,St Columcille's Hospital Loughlinstown,I found my consultant brusque to the border of rudeness.
21,Kerry General Hospital,Best ever
22,Royal Victoria Eye and Ear,Two visits recently. O
23,Cork University Hospital,I was initially referred in 2014 for cervical nerve protrusions confirmed by 4 MRIs. Now I have to get nerve conduction tests and was told it will take months??? I am steadily going downhill from the constant pain and getting depressed because I feel I have been abandoned by the system simply because I am a public patient. I know private patients (my siblings) who have had surgeries years before me with the same issues. It is very disheartening. I now have to wait again in pain for months for more tests. They could have been doing these all along while I was waiting.
24,"Mid Western Regional, Limerick","A&E is a joke, too many people left on trolleys for long periods of time, with very little interaction with staff. On the day my partner was brought in by ambulance, he was on a trolley in A&E at lunchtime. When the food trolley was going around, he left his trolley as he was feeling a bit panicky. I went and asked for food and was told by a very rude individual that as he was not on his trolley he could not get food outside the area, 'it was the rules'. The ambulance, resuscitation dept and most of the staff in 3A were brilliant. However, training is needed for a lot of the others, some of them could not answer basic questions!"
25,St James's Hospital Dublin,Hope these staff are looked after well by management and told how good they are.
26,Mater Private Hospital,"I pay top dollar to use this hospital and the care standard by doctors was brutal. I was admitted with a particular issue which is dangerous but I was released and told it's normal by a doctor. I was told after discharge that I had a very bad deep bacterial infection and needed treatment. I came home and rang my doctor and he is appalled at the treatment . I was let home with a blood count of ten which signals I am anaemic but this also was never treated. Having spent six days there I'm so annoyed at the lack of care and results coordination between consultants. I feel sick and have been left to sort my own treatment, this is appalling."
27,Royal Victoria Eye and Ear,"I attended this hospital with my mother, she is 87. We were told to be at the hospital for 7am to find the doors not open in the ear /nose/throat dept until 8am. Doctors come in at 9am. I felt there was an attitude towards us because we were sent from Wexford, we were asked why we were not sent to Waterford. Rooms and corridors are tatty, as is some of the furniture in the waiting area, which may I add is a passage way covered over with iron sheeting. Clearly there has been little if any investment in the building. TOTAL SHAMBLES."
28,"University College Hospital, Galway",I presented at A&E after being hit by a car. I was a pedestrian and had suffered a blow to my back with many cuts and bruises. I asked for some cold packs for the swelling while waiting and was told they didn't have any. A member of staff advised my friend who accompanied me that he could possible get some ice at Supermacs. That sums up my experience.
29,Mayo General Hospital,"Attended this hospital on a Saturday evening with my 8-year old daughter who had broken her arm. Was quickly seen by the triage nurse who checked it over and gave pain meds. We then had to wait for a couple of hours for the doctor to see her. Seen and sent for x ray. On arrival back from x-ray, seen immediately by doctor again and x-ray read on the spot and explained to us. Had another hour or so wait for a temporary cast to be applied and appointment given to see the trauma team on Monday morning. Cast applied, appointment arranged and sent home with good advice on pain relief. Attended outpatients on the Monday and while very busy, was very well organised. Every member of staff seemed to know their role and carried it out quickly and efficiently. Had seen the doctor and hard cast applied by two very professional and friendly nurses in under two hours. Her follow up appointment for the clinic arrived the very next day by post. It was my first time attending this hospital and I have no hesitation in attending it again. This is the standard of care that is needed in our hospital system. The only thing I have to complain about was the attitude of one of the nurses towards us because we live in Co. Galway. Told us that Galway hospital would be nearer to us (even though it is not) and that they were trying to get patients from co. Galway to stay in Galway. Other than that, Mayo General Hospital is the best one I have attended yet."
